    - Note: You may wish to remove the default servers

1. Under "Add a server," add your electrs onion address from your electrs service page (found in your Embassy's electrs service page, under "Interfaces"), followed by :50001 for the port, as shown.  Remove the "http://" prefix, or BitBox will 
give an error.  Click "Check" to test.
